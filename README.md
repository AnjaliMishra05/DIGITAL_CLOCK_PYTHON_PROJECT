# DIGITAL_CLOCK_PYTHON_PROJECT
We have created digital clock using Tkinter.As we know Tkinter is used to create a variety of GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications. Using Label widget from Tkinter and time module ,
In the following application, we  have used Label widget and also  time module which is used to retrieve systemâ€™s time.
Function call and Run Application: Here in this step we will call the function to get current time and will use mainloop() function to Run Application.

Here as you can see that there are two libraries are imported in which tkinter library is using to create a GUI window and time library is using to get the current system time.

Function to get Current Time: Here in this step we will create a function that will return the current system time.

Here i have defined a function with name time(). strftime() function will return the current system time in the given format and it will store into variable str. In the third line the i have passed the current time to lbl, and the last line refresh the text in Label after every second.

Create GUI Window :Here in this step will will create a window to display the current time in Digital Format.

Here in the first line i have created a root variable for displaying a GUI window. In the second line title is set in the window and in the third line a label is created . The background color of label  is purple, text color is white , font-family is calibri and the font size of Label is 40. The variable name for the label is lbl.

Function call and Run Application: Here in this step we will call the function to get current time and will use mainloop() function to Run Application
